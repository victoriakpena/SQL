-- For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
-- Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
-- Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

-- Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL
);

-- Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.
-- Next, I explored the data using the following SQL: 

-- What is the avg popularity, danceability, and energy by artist and track?
Select artist_name, track_name, avg(popularity), avg(danceability), avg(energy)
From BIT_DB.Spotifydata
Group by artist_name, track_name;

-- What are the 10 most popular tracks?
Select track_name, popularity
From BIT_DB.Spotifydata
Order by popularity desc
Limit 10;

-- Who are the 10 most popular artists?
Select artist_name, avg(popularity)
From BIT_DB.Spotifydata
Group by artist_name
Order by popularity desc
Limit 10;

-- What is the average danceability by artist? 
Select artist_name, avg(danceability)
From BIT_DB.Spotifydata
Group by artist_name
Order by danceability desc;

-- What are the 5 shortest tracks in duration?
Select track_name, duration_ms
From BIT_DB.Spotifydata
Order by duration_ms asc
Limit 5;

-- Which artists have more than 1 track in the top 50?
Select artist_name, count(artist_name) as amount_tracks
From BIT_DB.Spotifydata
Group by artist_name
Having amount_tracks > 1
Order by amount_tracks desc;

-- Which track is the loudest with the highest energy?
Select track_name, loudness, energy
From BIT_DB.Spotifydata
Order by loudness desc, energy desc;

-- What is the speechiness of the track with the most dancibility?
Select track_name, speechiness, danceability
From BIT_DB.Spotifydata
Order by danceability desc
Limit 1;

-- What is the speechiness of the track with the least dancibility?
Select track_name, speechiness, danceability
From BIT_DB.Spotifydata
Order by danceability asc
Limit 1;
